# Nanogrpc example "network_server"

This example is adaptation of original example to work with nanogrpc.
Currently only server code is implemented. Client side encoding is
being done manually.

Usage same as in [original example](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/tree/master/examples/network_server)
